# CAPTCHA Gamification for Arabic Learning

## Project Info 

In this project, we developd a game using the CAPTCHA system for kids
and whoever wants to learn Arabic letters entertainingly and interactively. The
game provided several levels. At the basic level, users will solve sample
printed CAPTCHAs to learn letters. And each time the user solves one level it
will open new levels, And at higher levels in the game, the users will face more
challenging levels requiring them to write letters and check handwritten
CAPTCHA words using image processing. The project also is focusing on helping
young users to know useful information about awareness of cyber security and
internet safety as a reward after each level. And also in our project, we aim to
implement and do research to collect some data that can help us to develop and
extend our app later on.
